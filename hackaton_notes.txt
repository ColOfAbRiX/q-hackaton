Scan GIT repo
    Input:
        A GIT repository
    Language:
        Scala
    Suggested libraries
        Cats
        scala-git??? or JGit???
        Elastic4s
    Challenges:
        Find what library to use
        Scan the commits to see what and how much people changed
        Scan all directories to read how many lines of text are there
        Score the people against the changes
        ->Define the format inside elastic
        Update document in Elastic
    Output:
        Documents inside elastic with info for each directory


Simple REST API for frontend
    Input:
        Documents inside elastic with info for each directory
        What information to fetch
    Language:
        Python
    Suggested libraries
        Flask https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application
        ElasticSearch https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/7.10.0/
    Challenges:
        Create the actual endpoints
        Query elastic
    Output:
        REST endpoint that returns the documents in elastic


Visualize the data
    Input:
        Documents in elastic format
        REST endpoint
    Language:
        JavaScript/TypeScript
    Suggested libraries
        SigmaJS
    Challenges:
        Query the endpoint
        Transform the data received into Sigmajs format
    Output
        A graph that displays directories and what users have experience there
        Display one directory at the time, when people click directory expands
        Experience is cumulative per directory


Criteria for Scoring
    The "knowledge" K of a person in a directory is:
        Inversely proportional to the time passed
        Inversely proportional to the size of the project
        Proportional to the relative changes (number of lines/total lines)
        Proportional to how often the person changed the same code/directory
    Notes
        Nothing we can do for squashed commits
        We could scan branches but they might never end up in master
        "K" should be a pure number
        Scores of subdirectories must add up for the parent directory
